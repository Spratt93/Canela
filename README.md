# Canela

### Querying language for simple [Turtle files](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/)

This language was written in Haskell.
- [Alex](https://haskell-alex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used to generate the lexer.
- [Happy](https://haskell-happy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used to generate the parser.
- The execution model was implemented in base Haskell

Canela performs operations on Turtle files like *foo.ttl* 

Our chosen file extension for Canela files is *stql*

The syntax of our language is detailed in the report
